how to compile:

RECOMMENDED: 
1. import into CLion via version control 
2. click "run", the CLion project should be set up automatically

MANUALLY: 
1. run cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" path/you/cloned/this/repo/to
2. alternativly, if cmake debug is not desire: cmake .
3. i'll be hones: not a C expert here. i'm using an IDE, don't know much more...
